# Rhizome

A deliberately minimal cross-platform task runner.

This is **VERY** much an in-progress-pre-alpha project.


# TODO

- Document operation and functions
- Record motivation
- Set up CI


# Caveats

- Doesn't do any shell expansion
- Doens't play well with symlinks
- Only intended to operate on files and directories
